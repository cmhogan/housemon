sudo cp run_sensors.service /etc/services/system/
systemctl enable run_sensors

ADD: 

dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=14

too /boot/config.txt

sudo sh -c 'grep "w1_therm" /etc/modules || echo "w1_therm" >> /etc/modules'
sudo sh -c 'grep "w1_gpio" /etc/modules || echo "w1_gpio" >> /etc/modules'

enable 1-wire in raspi-config

reboot

Then if you do not have a pullup resistor physically installed with the sensor,
you will need to enable the internal pi resistor with the first couple of lines 
from one of the run_sensors.py, like:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

GPIO_PIN_NUMBER=14
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)

You can change the GPIO_PIN_NUMBER to whichever pin you have the data line from
the sensor on. 

check device name in /sys/bus/w1/devices and add it to a new sensor (and 
possibly a new location) in the database

reboot
